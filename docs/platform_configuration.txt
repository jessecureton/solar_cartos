 * To allow consistent features across multiple processors, each processor must have implementations of a basic
 * set of functions in a consistent way - things like setting the clock frequency, defining what hardware is
 * available, doing the proper platform initialization, etc. These must be named consistently, and have consistent
 * results.
 * \n\n
 * This is known as the platform API, and it is requires implementation of the following function protoypes. Full
 * documentation for each can be seen in {@link platform.h} or by following the function links below.
 * 
 * 1. <code>err_t platform_proc_init()</code>
 * 2. <code>err_t platform_set_sysclk(uint32_t hertz)</code>
 * 3. <code>void platform_proc_sleep()</code>
 * 4. <code>void platform_sch_tick()</code> - This doesn't need to be named as such, but there must be some
 *      platform-specific interrupt triggered by a timer at the desired SCH_TICK rate (typically 1ms), and it
 *      must call {@link schInterrupt()} after dealing with any platform-specific wake from sleep code.
 *
 * The platform API also defines some standard wide-scope variables for system status. They are as follows
 * 
 * 1. {@link platform_sysclk}
