 * To allow consistent features across multiple processors, each processor must have implementations of a basic
 * set of functions in a consistent way - things like setting the clock frequency, defining what hardware is
 * available, doing the proper platform initialization, etc. These must be named consistently, and have consistent
 * results.
 * \n\n
 * This is known as the platform API, and it is requires implementation of the following function protoypes. Full
 * documentation for each can be seen in {@link platforms.h} or by following the function links below.
 * 
 * 1. <code>err_t platform_proc_init()</code>
 * 2. <code>err_t platform_set_sysclk(uint32_t hertz)</code>
